      <h1>Isabelle Coughlin</h1>
      <p> Hey there! Excited to introduce myself as a first-year student diving into the vibrant academic landscape of <a href="https://cs.wfu.edu/">Wake Forest University</a>.
        I'm on the path to a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, with minors in computer science and mathematics, all driven by an insatiable curiosity about the cosmos.
        In addition to my studies, I'm hoping to delve into research in astrophysics, blending my passion for exploring the universe with hands-on inquiry.</p>

      <p> When I'm not in lectures or buried in textbooks, you'll likely find me immersed in string theory, as part of my current research work. I am working under the guidance of Dr. Merkx, a
        professor of Mathematics at Wake Forest, looking into the nature of 6D SCFT (superconformal field theories) and developing a programming algorithm to classify them--largely following
        the work of prominent researcher Miles Reid and his work in the area.
        Whether it be peering into the depths of black holes or studying the dynamics of distant galaxies, I'm eager to uncover the secrets of the cosmos and contribute to our understanding of the universe's grand tapestry.
        Collaboration fuels my drive, and I'm always seeking opportunities to team up with fellow students and faculty members in pursuit of knowledge. </p>
      <p> Beyond the classroom, I have an adventurous and creative spirit--loving to travel, hike, run, draw, and paint. I find beauty in the world and
        hope to explore the world and pursue my passions to the fullest of my abilities. </p>
      <p> In essence, my journey at Wake Forest isn't just about earning a degree; it's about pushing the boundaries of what we know and exploring the frontiers of discovery.
        I'm here to soak up every opportunity, from rigorous academic challenges to hands-on research experiences, all in the pursuit of making meaningful contributions to our understanding of the world around us.</p>

            <li>Officially titled as "Math 381 - Independent Study", I have been working alongside Dr. Merkx, a Wake Forest professor of
        Mathematics in topics related to string theory. More specifically, I have spent this semester dissecting the research done by Dr. Miles Reid
        in his paper "Surface cyclic quotient singularities and Hirzeburch-Jung resolutions." I am now working to create a computational algorithm, building
        on top of code already written by Dr. Merkx, to produce the results that Dr. Reid concluded in Section 5 of said paper. This code is written in Mathematica.</li>
