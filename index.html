      <h1>Isabelle Coughlin</h1>
      <p> Hey there! Excited to introduce myself as a first-year student diving into the vibrant academic landscape of <a href="https://cs.wfu.edu/">Wake Forest University</a>.
        I'm on the path to a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, with minors in computer science and mathematics, all driven by an insatiable curiosity about the cosmos.
        Beyond the classroom, I'm hoping to delve into research in astrophysics, blending my passion for exploring the universe with hands-on inquiry.
        When I'm not in lectures or buried in textbooks, you'll likely find me immersed in [insert more] as part of my current research work.
        Whether it's peering into the depths of black holes or studying the dynamics of distant galaxies, I'm eager to uncover the secrets of the cosmos and contribute to our understanding of the universe's grand tapestry.
        Collaboration fuels my drive, and I'm always seeking opportunities to team up with fellow students and faculty members in pursuit of knowledge.
        In essence, my journey at Wake Forest isn't just about earning a degree; it's about pushing the boundaries of what we know and exploring the frontiers of discovery.
        I'm here to soak up every opportunity, from rigorous academic challenges to hands-on research experiences, all in the pursuit of making meaningful contributions to our understanding of the world around us.
